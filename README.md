Adventures in OS Development.

## Goals

* Learn about OS development.
* Break things and have fun.

## Non-goals

* No one should use this for anything.
* No one should expect this to ever actually be finished.


## Building

On Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install build-essential bison flex libgmp3-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev texinfo qemu-system-i386 xorriso nasm

I followed this guide to build a cross-compiler: https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler
